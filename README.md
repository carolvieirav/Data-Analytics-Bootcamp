# Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp

## Module 1: Introduction to and Python

Topics include:

- Introductions to data wrangling/cleaning.

- APIs and web scraping.

- Intermediate levels of Git, SQL and Python.

Week three calls for the first project as an apprentice data analyst, conducting data analysis with real datasets.

## Module 2: Advanced Data Analytics

In weeks four and five: mathematics behind data analytics.

Topics include:

- Utilizing Python to understand inferential statistics and probability.

- Incorporating Python into the fundamentals of business intelligence.

- Learning story-telling techniques in order to visualize your data and insights in presentations.

Week six will mark the start of the second project: a complete data analysis. Constructed from data processed in the weeks before, cleaned and visualized from real datasets!

## Module 3: Get a handle on the fundamentals of machine learning

The final module will introduce the fundamentals of machine learning in weeks seven and eight. Understand the machine workflow, and the lessons will only expand from there.

Topics include:

- Both supervised and unsupervised learning.

- The essentials of popular machine learning algorithms.

- Building, training and evaluating models with the Scikit-Learn machine learning library.

For the last week of this module the task is to build an end-to-end machine learning project. Process a dataset, extract features, train a model, and use that model to make predictions on new data.
